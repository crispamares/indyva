Publish & Subscribe with AutobahnPython
=======================================

The examples here show how to do and make use of the PubSub functionality that
AutobahnPython provides.

Using PubSub, you can decouple publishers and subscribers via topics and implement
sophisticated real-time enabled applications.

PubSub in AutobahnPython relies on standard [WAMP](http://wamp.ws), and hence can be used with
any WAMP client (or server), such as AutobahnPython, AutobahnJS, AutobahnAndroid and others.
