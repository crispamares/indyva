# Indyva

Indyva (an acronym for INteractive DYnamics for Visual Analytics) is a new framework for building Visual Analytics prototypes easily and fast. Indyva solves several problems, like the synchronization between components or reusing code by writing each component in a different programming language.

Powerful visualization and analytical frameworks already exist, but there is no common programming language for all of them, the over-the-network API solves this problem.

The main goal is to reduce drastically the "time-to-market" of Visual Analytics applications by reusing as much code as possible. Specially of complex moving parts like the modeling of the user interaction.
