Introduction
============

Indyva (Interactive Dynamics for Visual Analytics) is a framework that
makes easy the creation of Visual Analytics prototypes.

Indyva was designed with a particular scenario in mind. The initial
goal was to reduce the developing time of interactive prototypes in
research domains. In places like University Labs is very common that
these prototypes are implemented by one person or by very small groups
of people. Usually in these situations the focus is not on creating
high quality software but having something done quickly so the
researchers can test new ideas with final users. 

The election of the technology (programming language, and libraries)
can be guided by personal preferences of the developer, by the 'not
reinventing the wheel' principle, or by an integrative effort of tools
inside a group legacy. None of these alternatives is the silver bullet
for productivity. Sometimes the developer is very productive with some
technology and is the way to go, but sometimes the most powerful
libraries for a problem are written in other programming languages so
is better to change the stack. The third strategy enhance productivity
by reusing in-house developments. 

Indyva is a framework that let the developer take advantage of the
best of these three strategies:

* Indyva provides a model for common dataset types as well as a model
  for interaction states, so you can design totally decoupled
  components that will integrate and interact without hassle. 
* Indyva is base on services so you can scale each part as you need
  easier.
* Indyva is a solid base for polyglot programming so you can use your
  preferred programming language.
* Indyva is not opinionated about interactive or rendering technologies so you can choose the best technology for each interface.
